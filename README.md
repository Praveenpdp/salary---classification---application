üßë‚Äçüíº Employee Salary Classification App

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether an employee earns more than ‚Çπ50K per year based on personal and professional attributes. It uses a trained classification model and is built using Streamlit for an interactive UI.

 Internship & Guidance

This project was developed as part of a 6-week AI & ML internship offered by Edunet Foundation through IBM SkillsBuild. The internship provided practical exposure to data preprocessing, model training, and deployment techniques using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Special thanks to the program mentors and coordinators for their continuous support and guidance.
